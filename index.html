                <p>Congratulations, new FICSIT Pioneer! You are about to embark on a journey across the stars to a destination most fantastical: MASSAGE-2(A-B)b in the binary star system of Akycha.
                    Once planetside, you will be tasked with finding natural resources, constructing machines to mine and process them, and automating the process to further exploit the planet.
                    Initial surveys suggest 4 particular biomes as relatively safe landing zones. </p>

                        the distances between mining locations, building outposts and/or large transportation lines
                        may be necessary eventually."/>

                        A lush building location with man height differences and few open areas, challanging conventional building and planning methods.
                        Despite these challanges, it caught our eye due to the richness of its resources.">
